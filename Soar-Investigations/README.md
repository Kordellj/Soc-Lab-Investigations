# SOAR Investigation Lab

## Overview
This lab documents hands-on experience with Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) concepts.

The objective was to understand how SOAR platforms automate repetitive SOC tasks, reduce analyst workload, and improve incident response time.

## Scenario
Simulated alert handling workflow using SOAR principles.

Investigated how automated playbooks can:
- Enrich alerts with threat intelligence
- Perform automated containment actions
- Reduce manual triage steps
- Escalate incidents when necessary

---

## Key Concepts Learned
- Playbooks and workflow automation
- Alert enrichment
- Integration with SIEM tools
- Incident response automation
- Reduction of Mean Time To Respond (MTTR)

---

## Skills Practiced
- Incident triage logic
- Automation workflow design
- Understanding tool integrations
- Analyst decision-making in automated environments

---

## SOC Impact
SOAR improves efficiency by automating repetitive tasks and allowing analysts to focus on high-risk investigations and threat hunting.
